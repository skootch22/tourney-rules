# ⚾ Tournament Rules Viewer

A mobile-friendly web page for looking up baseball tournament rules. Data is pulled live from a published Google Sheet, so rules can be updated by anyone with sheet access — no code changes needed.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The main web page |
| `config.js` | Configuration — put your Google Sheet URL here |
| `mockup.html` | Standalone preview with sample data (no sheet required) |

---

## Setup

### 1. Create your Google Sheet

Set up a sheet with the following columns. **Column order doesn't matter** — the app finds each column by its header name. The first row must be a header row with these exact names (spelling and capitalization must match).

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Active | Boolean | `TRUE`, `yes`, or `1` to include in dropdown |
| Tournament | Text | Tournament name shown in the dropdown |
| Location | Text | Venue / city |
| Time Limit | Text | e.g. `1:45` |
| Innings | Integer | e.g. `6` |
| Mercy Rule | HTML | Supports `<ul>`, `<strong>`, `<p>`, etc. |
| Pitching Limits | HTML | Supports `<ul>`, `<strong>`, `<p>`, etc. |
| Balks | Text | e.g. `Enforced` or `Warning first` |
| Courtesy Runner | Text | e.g. `Pitcher & catcher only` |
| Extra Inning | HTML | Supports `<ul>`, `<strong>`, `<p>`, etc. |
| Tie Breaker | HTML | Supports `<ul>`, `<strong>`, `<p>`, etc. |
| Rules URL | URL | Optional. Link to official rules PDF or page. Leave blank to hide the button. |
| Notes | HTML | Optional. Anything that doesn't fit elsewhere. Supports `<ul>`, `<strong>`, `<p>`, etc. |
| Sort Order | Number | Optional. Controls dropdown order (1, 2, 3…). Tournaments without a value appear last. |
| Start Date | Text | Optional. Tournament start date, e.g. `June 6, 2025`. |
| End Date | Text | Optional. Tournament end date. If same as start date, only one date is shown. |
| Dropped Third Strike | HTML | Optional. Enforced or not, and any nuances. |
| Stealing Rules | HTML | Optional. What stealing is permitted, any restrictions. |
| Field Type | Text | Optional. `turf`, `grass`, or `mixed`. Displays as a badge in the header. |
| Substitution Rules | HTML | Optional. Re-entry rules, free substitution, DH rules, etc. Supports rich HTML formatting. |

> **HTML fields:** You can use basic HTML directly in those sheet cells. For example, a Mercy Rule cell might contain:
> ```html
> <p><strong>10 runs</strong> after 4 innings<br><strong>8 runs</strong> after 5 innings</p>
> ```

### 2. Publish the sheet as CSV

1. In Google Sheets, go to **File → Share → Publish to web**
2. In the first dropdown, select your sheet tab
3. In the second dropdown, select **Comma-separated values (.csv)**
4. Click **Publish** and copy the URL

### 3. Add the URL to `config.js`

Open `config.js` and replace the placeholder:

```js
SHEET_URL: "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SHEET_ID/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv",
```

### 4. Deploy

Upload both `index.html` and `config.js` to the **same folder** on your web host. Any static hosting works — GitHub Pages, Netlify, a school or league website, etc.

## How It Works

1. On page load, the app fetches the published CSV from Google Sheets
2. Only rows with `Active = TRUE` appear in the dropdown
3. When a user selects a tournament and clicks **View Rules**, the rule cards populate below
4. If a **Rules URL** is provided, a button linking to the official rules document appears at the bottom
5. If no Rules URL is set for a tournament, that button is hidden automatically

---

## Updating Rules

Since the page reads live from Google Sheets, keeping rules up to date is simple:

- **Edit a rule** — update the cell in the sheet. Changes appear on the next page load.
- **Add a tournament** — add a new row and set Active to `TRUE`.
- **Deactivate a tournament** — set Active to `FALSE` (or delete the row). It will no longer appear in the dropdown.
- **No code changes needed** for any of the above.

## Previewing Without a Sheet

Open `mockup.html` in any browser. It uses hardcoded sample data and does not require a Google Sheet or internet connection. Use it to preview layout changes or share with others before the sheet is ready.

## Troubleshooting

**Error says "Missing sheet columns: …"**
- The app couldn't find one or more expected header names in your sheet's first row
- Check spelling and capitalization exactly match the names in `config.js` — e.g. `Time Limit` not `time limit` or `TimeLimit`
- Make sure row 1 of your sheet is the header row, not a blank row or data row
- Check that the URL in `config.js` is correct and was published as CSV (not HTML)
- Republish the sheet — sometimes the publish step needs to be repeated after changes
- Open the URL directly in a browser to verify it returns raw CSV text

**My edits to the sheet aren't showing up**
- Google's publishing cache can take a few minutes to refresh
- Hard-refresh the page (`Ctrl+Shift+R` / `Cmd+Shift+R`) to bypass the browser cache

**The page works locally but not when hosted**
- Make sure `config.js` is in the same folder as `index.html` on your server
- Confirm your host serves `.js` files (virtually all do)

**A tournament isn't appearing in the dropdown**
- Verify the Active column for that row contains exactly `TRUE`, `yes`, or `1`
- Check that the row isn't empty in the Tournament column
